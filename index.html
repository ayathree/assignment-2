            <p class="section-1-des">There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”</p>

                <li class="first-l">Borobudur dates from the 9th century and is one of the largest Buddhist temple.</li>
                <li class="first-l">The ancient Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza have been drawing curious tourists since they were first brought to light by a popular book by John Lloyd Stevens in 1843.</li>

            <p class="section-1-des">“Adventure” this word itself is an invitation to massive adrenaline rush, number of emotions such as excitement, fear, nervousness, thrill & danger are felt all at once on thinking about it. Technically, adventure is an unusual & daring experience. People usually go for an adventure trip in their leisure time so as to revive their spirit after utterly exhausting schedule of routine life.</p>
